# Alembic Versions Directory

This directory contains the database migration scripts generated by Alembic.

Each migration file represents a specific change to the database schema.

## How to Create a New Migration

To auto-generate a migration based on model changes:

```bash
make migrate msg="description of changes"
```

Or manually:

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```

## How to Apply Migrations

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
make upgrade
```

Or manually:

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

## How to Rollback Migrations

To downgrade by one revision:

```bash
uv run alembic downgrade -1
```

To downgrade to a specific revision:

```bash
uv run alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```
